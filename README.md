=================

Work In Progress.

## How to use

After install it, open the extension, click on Wow faucet and click on So many faucets. Then choose a faucet and fill the wallet field.
You now have a timer until the next time you can go on this faucet ! It will autofill the wallet adress when you will go on the faucet and autodetect when you successfully use the faucet and update the timer. You can click on Such Numbers for stats.

You can write in url faucet: to access quickly to faucet.
